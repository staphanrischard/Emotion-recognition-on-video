Here is an example of how you can use the OpenCV library to capture a video from a webcam and the pre-trained model from deepface library to perform emotion recognition on each frame:

import cv2
from deepface import DeepFace

# Initialize the webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Load the pre-trained model
deepface = DeepFace.build_model()

while True:
    # Capture a frame from the webcam
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Resize the frame to a smaller size
    frame = cv2.resize(frame, (0, 0), fx=0.5, fy=0.5)

    # Perform emotion recognition on the frame
    result = deepface.analyze(frame, actions=['emotion'])
    emotion = result['emotion']

    # Display the frame with the emotion label
    cv2.imshow("Emotion recognition", frame)
    cv2.putText(frame, emotion, (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    cv2.imshow("Emotion recognition", frame)

    # Exit the program when the 'q' key is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the webcam and close the window
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
